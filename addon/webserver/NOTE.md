To add a new page you should do the following:-

1) Put html in pages subdirectory. Make sure to use Mustache markup for the variable parts
2) Write a new handler for your page. The purpose of this is to return the html and to populate the Mustache context with the variables it needs for rendering the page. To do this, you need to provide implementations of two methods. Check the "mountpage.cpp" for a simple example
3) Add your new page to the page handler registry. You need to import the header file of your new page, create a static instance and add a route
4) Edit the Makefile to add your new class to the OBJS. Also add a new line to show that your class depends on a header file which should be the name of your html but using .h instead of .html. The .h file will be generated for you.

To add a new static asset e.g image, css, js, etc, you should do the following:-

1) Put asset in assets subdirectory. Make sure it's not too large. The limit right now is 32k.
2) Edit handlers/asset.cpp to add your new asset to the registry. You must include the header file. This is auto generated and will be <yourassetfilename>.h. You must also add the route mapping to map the url to the actual asset. The name of the header variable is also autogenerated.
3) Edit the Makefile to add a new dependendy for asset.o. This will be the name of your asset but with a .h extension instead of .jpg or whatever.
