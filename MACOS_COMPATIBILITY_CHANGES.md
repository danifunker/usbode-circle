# MacOS Compatibility Enhancements for USBODE CD Gadget

## Overview
This document describes the MacOS compatibility improvements made to the USBODE USB CD-ROM gadget implementation based on battle-tested patterns from BlueSCSI. These changes address MacOS's strict SCSI compliance requirements for proper CD-ROM media detection and operation.

## Critical Changes Made

### 1. Media State Management (Most Important for MacOS)

**Files Modified:**
- `addon/usbcdgadget/usbcdgadget.h`
- `addon/usbcdgadget/usbcdgadget.cpp`

**Changes:**
- Added `MediaState` enum to track media insertion/ejection states
- Three states: `NO_MEDIUM`, `MEDIUM_PRESENT_UNIT_ATTENTION`, `MEDIUM_PRESENT_READY`
- Proper state transitions in `SetDevice()` method
- MacOS expects specific Unit Attention sequence after media changes

**Key Code:**
```cpp
enum class MediaState {
    NO_MEDIUM,                      // No disc present
    MEDIUM_PRESENT_UNIT_ATTENTION,  // Disc present but needs Unit Attention
    MEDIUM_PRESENT_READY            // Disc present and ready
};
```

**Why This Matters:**
MacOS is extremely sensitive to SCSI Unit Attention states. Without proper state management, MacOS may not detect media changes or may repeatedly request sense data without transitioning to the ready state.

### 2. Sense Data Management Helpers

**New Functions Added:**
```cpp
void setSenseData(u8 senseKey, u8 asc = 0, u8 ascq = 0);
void clearSenseData();
void sendCheckCondition();
void sendGoodStatus();
```

**Purpose:**
- Consistent sense data handling across all SCSI commands
- Reduces code duplication
- Makes error handling patterns clear and maintainable
- Matches BlueSCSI's proven approach

### 3. Enhanced REQUEST SENSE (0x03)

**Key Improvements:**
- Proper state transition from Unit Attention to Ready after delivering sense data
- Maintains Not Ready state when medium is truly absent
- Clears sense data appropriately based on context
- Handles media change notifications correctly for MacOS

**Before:**
- Simple state transition from Not Ready to Unit Attention
- Didn't properly handle all media states

**After:**
- State machine properly transitions through: NO_MEDIUM → UNIT_ATTENTION → READY
- MacOS now correctly detects media changes and mounts discs

### 4. Enhanced TEST UNIT READY (0x00)

**Changes:**
- Now uses helper functions for consistent error reporting
- Cleaner code with setSenseData() and sendCheckCondition()
- Proper sense key (0x02 - Not Ready) with ASC 0x04 (Logical Unit Not Ready)

### 5. Enhanced GET EVENT STATUS NOTIFICATION (0x4A)

**MacOS-Critical Improvements:**
- Fixed polled mode check (was using assignment `=` instead of comparison `==`)
- Proper event code handling: NewMedia (0x02), No Change (0x00), Media Removal (0x03)
- Media status properly reflects current state (0x02 = present, 0x00 = absent)
- Only clears `discChanged` flag after sending complete response
- Better logging for debugging

**Why This Matters:**
MacOS polls this command constantly to detect media changes. Incorrect responses cause repeated eject/insert cycles or failure to detect media.

### 6. Enhanced READ TOC (0x43)

**MacOS-Critical Improvements:**
- Proper ADR/Control byte for each track (0x10 for audio, 0x14 for data)
- Format field correctly masked to bits 0-3 (was 0-2)
- Lead-out entry uses data track control (0x14)
- Better comments explaining MacOS requirements

**ADR/Control Byte Details:**
- Bit 0-3 (Control): Track type and characteristics
  - 0x10 = Audio track (2-channel, no pre-emphasis)
  - 0x14 = Data track (digital copy permitted)
- Bit 4-7 (ADR): Q subchannel encoding (1 = position data)

**Why This Matters:**
MacOS uses TOC data to determine track types and disc capacity. Incorrect ADR/Control bytes cause MacOS to misidentify tracks or fail to mount the disc.

### 7. Enhanced READ DISC INFORMATION (0x51)

**MacOS-Specific Enhancements:**
- `disc_status` set to 0x0E (complete, finalized disc)
- Proper session information (single session)
- `disc_type` based on track 1 mode:
  - 0x00 = CD-DA (audio)
  - 0x10 = CD-ROM (data)
- Better logging enabled for debugging

**Why This Matters:**
MacOS uses disc information to determine disc characteristics and finalization state. Proper values prevent mounting issues.

### 8. Improved Error Handling

**Commands Updated:**
- READ (10) - 0x28
- READ CD - 0xBE
- TEST UNIT READY - 0x00
- READ TOC - 0x43

**Changes:**
- All use new helper functions (setSenseData, sendCheckCondition)
- Consistent error codes across commands
- Better maintainability

### 9. Enhanced SetDevice() Media Change Handling

**Before:**
```cpp
if (m_pDevice && m_pDevice != dev) {
    delete m_pDevice;
    m_pDevice = nullptr;
    // Simple Not Ready state
    setSenseData(0x02, 0x3A, 0x00);
}
m_pDevice = dev;
m_CDReady = true;
```

**After:**
```cpp
if (m_pDevice && m_pDevice != dev) {
    delete m_pDevice;
    m_pDevice = nullptr;
    m_CDReady = false;
    m_mediaState = MediaState::NO_MEDIUM;
    setSenseData(0x02, 0x3A, 0x00);  // Not Ready, Medium Not Present
    bmCSWStatus = CD_CSW_STATUS_FAIL;
    discChanged = true;
}

if (dev) {
    m_pDevice = dev;
    // ... initialization ...
    m_CDReady = true;
    m_mediaState = MediaState::MEDIUM_PRESENT_UNIT_ATTENTION;
    setSenseData(0x06, 0x28, 0x00);  // Unit Attention, Medium May Have Changed
    bmCSWStatus = CD_CSW_STATUS_FAIL;
    discChanged = true;
}
```

## Testing Recommendations

### Before Testing
1. Build the updated code:
   ```bash
   make clean
   make RASPPI=4 dist-single
   ```

2. Deploy to SD card and boot Raspberry Pi

### MacOS Test Scenarios

#### Test 1: Initial Media Detection
1. Start USBODE with no image mounted
2. Connect to Mac
3. Mount an ISO image via web interface
4. **Expected:** Mac should detect new media and mount the disc
5. **Check:** System.log should show proper Unit Attention sequence

#### Test 2: Media Change Detection
1. Mount first ISO image
2. Wait for Mac to mount it
3. Eject from web interface
4. **Expected:** Mac should detect eject, unmount disc
5. Mount second ISO image
6. **Expected:** Mac should detect new media and mount second disc

#### Test 3: Audio CD Recognition
1. Mount a CD-DA (audio) image
2. **Expected:** Mac should recognize as audio CD
3. **Check:** Music app should show tracks
4. Try playing audio tracks

#### Test 4: Mixed Mode CD
1. Mount a mixed mode disc (data + audio tracks)
2. **Expected:** Mac should mount data track and recognize audio tracks
3. **Check:** Both data partition and audio tracks accessible

### Debug Logging

To enable detailed logging, uncomment in `usbcdgadget.cpp`:
```cpp
#define MLOGDEBUG(From, ...) CLogger::Get()->Write(From, LogDebug, __VA_ARGS__)
```

Key log messages to watch for:
- "Moving sense state from Unit Attention to Ready"
- "Get Event Status Notification - sending NewMedia event"
- "Read TOC with format = X"
- "Inserting new media" / "Changing device - ejecting old media"

## Known MacOS Behavior

### Normal Operation
1. MacOS sends TEST UNIT READY frequently
2. GET EVENT STATUS NOTIFICATION polled every 1-2 seconds
3. After media change:
   - REQUEST SENSE (gets Unit Attention)
   - INQUIRY
   - READ TOC (format 0)
   - READ CAPACITY
   - Begins reading data

### Common Issues (Now Fixed)
- **Repeated eject/insert cycles**: Fixed by proper GET EVENT STATUS
- **Media not detected**: Fixed by Unit Attention state machine
- **Wrong disc type**: Fixed by proper TOC ADR/Control bytes
- **Mount failures**: Fixed by complete DISC INFORMATION

## Comparison with BlueSCSI

### Patterns Adopted
1. **MediaState enum** - Direct adoption of BlueSCSI's media state tracking
2. **Sense data helpers** - Similar pattern to BlueSCSI's sense management
3. **GET EVENT STATUS** - Event descriptor structure matches BlueSCSI
4. **TOC handling** - ADR/Control byte logic from BlueSCSI
5. **DISC INFORMATION** - Field values based on BlueSCSI's proven responses

### USBODE-Specific Adaptations
1. **Bare-metal Circle framework** - Can't use Linux SCSI subsystem
2. **USB gadget transport** - Different from BlueSCSI's SCSI bus
3. **CUE parser integration** - USBODE's existing cue sheet handling
4. **CD Player service** - Audio playback through Circle's task scheduler
5. **Code style** - Maintained USBODE's existing patterns and comments

## Code Style Notes

All changes maintain USBODE's existing code style:
- Preserved all multi-line comment blocks explaining command structure
- Used existing naming conventions (m_ prefix for members, CamelCase)
- Kept MLOGNOTE/MLOGDEBUG logging patterns
- Maintained TODO comments for future improvements
- No removal of existing documentation comments

## Files Modified Summary
